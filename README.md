# Raspberry-Pi-Ferminal
A Fake Terminal Window built with a Raspberry Pi and Python

I created a retro video player a while back and always wanted to reuse the screen and display to build a Fake Terminal, a Ferminal.  It took a while to work out how to get each letter to display on the correct line.  This is because you can enter your letter on a keyboard and the display updates in real time.  

- Use Python 3+
- This version built using Raspberry Pi 4
